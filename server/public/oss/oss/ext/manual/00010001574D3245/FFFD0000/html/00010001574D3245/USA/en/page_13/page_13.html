                    <p>After your baby learns to crawls they next need to know how to balance. In order for your baby to learn how to walk they will need to know how to balance.  Take your baby to the playroom or the garden to practice balancing with your baby.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><em>Prepare Food</em></p>
                    <p>Once your baby reaches the appropriate age it will be time for your baby to stop using the bottle and switch to food. When this happens you will need to prepare food instead of a bottle when your baby is hungry. There are many different ingredients you can purchase from the Food Shop in town.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>After preparing the food it is time to feed your baby. Be careful when feeding your baby solid food, it might be too hot! When you take a spoonful from the plate, wave the spoon back and forth in the air to cool the food so you do not burn your baby's mouth.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Giving the Bottle</p>
