                      Kurt Hectic never wanted to be a hero. He would have been content with
                      a normal life, living his years in quiet, dignified anonymity, but it was not
                      to be. Kurt was a loyal employee, and working for eccentric genius Doctor
                      Fluke Hawkins meant occasionally doing the extraordinary. In utter
                      disbelief, Kurt was eventually called upon to leave his beloved Earth,
                      assuming the unlikely title of first janitor in space.

                    <p class="spacer20tu">
                      Doctor Hawkins had long suffered ridicule from his fellow scientists. They
                      claimed he was too eccentric, and that his methods were questionable at
                      best. In time Hawkins grew tired of hearing such things, and seeking to
                      work undisturbed he fled the earth into a self-imposed exile. His ship, the
                      ‘Jim Dandy,’ was launched without fanfare, and he swore not to return
                      until he had vindicated himself in the eyes of his peers. Weeks turned to
                      months and months slowly turned to years.

                    <p class="spacer20tu">
                      The greatest of the Doctor’s inventions in exile was a six-legged canine
                      named Max, the first successful attempt by Dr. Hawkins to create an
                      artificial intelligence. ‘Successful’ meant that he never tried to kill the
                      good doctor, and had no plans for global domination. The perfect
                      assistant, Max kept the Doctor grounded in reality, and performed much
                      the same function as the safety-catch on an assault rifle. He was eager to
                      please and adaptable to any task, his gentle soul oddly balanced with an
                      affinity for firepower.
                    </p>
                    <p class="spacer20tu">
                      The time for Doctor Hawkins to prove the real merit of his genius came
                      sooner than anyone could have expected. Creatures from a strange
                      dimension attacked the Earth, riding ‘energy streams’ to the surface and
                      stripping it of all mineral wealth. They landed great machines: ‘minecrawlers’ that destroyed everything in their path and laid waste to
                      entire cities. The forces of Earth were helpless before the onslaught.
                    </p>

                    <p class="spacer20tu">
                      Watching the devastation on Earth, the crew of the ‘Jim Dandy’ knew they
                      had to act. Kurt was outfitted in the most radical of the Doctor’s creations:
                      an untested armored ‘Coil Suit,’ with chain-gun and a sniper rifle
                      ordinance that could target enemies a mile away. Leaping from the ship
                      on an unconventional parachute of ribbon, Kurt had to make his way to
                      the pilot of each minecrawler and hopefully disable the machines. Kurt
                      was reluctant, but he had no choice. He was the Earth’s last hope.
                    </p>
                    <p class="spacer20tu">
                      Kurt valiantly fought through the alien defenses, driving to the very heart
                      of each minecrawler, defeating pilot after pilot after pilot, with each falling
                      to his desperate determination. He ultimately challenged the evil
                      mastermind behind the attack, a grotesque, sadistic creature by the name
                      of Gunter Glut.

                    <p class="spacer20tu">
                      With the aid of Max and the Doctor’s inventions, Kurt was
                      able to take the fight directly to this diabolical beast, and was eventually
                      victorious in the climactic battle. The invasion crumbled and the aliens
                      retreated, their tails between their legs, leaving the Earth battered,
                      despoiled, even ruined, but not beaten. No, not beaten.
                      Now, with the aliens routed and order restored, our heroes can return to
                      their normal, everyday lives. Or can they? Only time will tell.
