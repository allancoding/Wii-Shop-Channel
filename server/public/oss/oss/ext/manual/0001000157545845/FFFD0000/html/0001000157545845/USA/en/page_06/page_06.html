  <p>Playing No-limit Texas Hold'em poker among friends can be a fun and thrilling experience, but it's important to know the rules of the game before starting. Unlike the standard 5-Card Stud, Texas Hold'em uses a dealer button to designate the theoretical dealer of each hand. After each hand has been completed, this &quot;button&quot; will move clockwise to the next active player. This player is referred to as &quot;the button&quot; and is considered to be &quot;the dealer&quot; for that hand. At the start of the game all players are dealt one card and the highest card dealt becomes the dealer.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>The First Round</strong></p>
<p>In the first round of gameplay, the player seated to the left of the button must post the small blind. The small blind is always equal to half the amount of the big blind. The player to the left of the small blind will place the big blind bet. All blinds in Texas Hold'em poker are considered a live bet, and the players who have made them have the option of calling, raising or folding when the betting returns to their position.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>After the blinds have been played, two cards are dealt to each active player, after which the first betting round begins with the player to the left of the big blind. There is no limit to the number, or quantity, of raises that a player may make in any round of no-limit hold'em.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>A player who does not have enough chips to call a bet is declared &quot;All-In&quot;. This player is eligible for only the fraction of the pot to the point of his final wager. All further betting action involving other players takes place in a &quot;side pot&quot;, which is unavailable to the player who has already gone &quot;All-In&quot;.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>The Second Round</strong><img src="ph_06_02.png" width="257" height="204" style="margin:0 0 0 10px;float:right;" /></p>
  <p>Once the first round of betting has completed, the dealer will 'burn' one card and reveals three community cards face-up on the table. This is known as The Flop. These community cards are common to all the players participating in the hand.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The second betting round begins with the first active player to the left of the button.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>The Third Round</strong></p>
  <p>The dealer will burn another card before revealing the fourth community card know as &quot;The Turn&quot; face-up on the table.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The third betting round begins with the first active player to the left of the button.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>The Fourth Round</strong></p>
  <p>After the third round of betting, the dealer burns the final round card and flips the fifth community card, known as The River card, face-up on the table.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The fourth, and final, betting round begins with the first active player to the left of the button.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>The Showdown</strong><img src="ph_06_03.png" width="257" height="204" style="margin:0 0 0 10px;float:right;" /></p>
  <p>If all others players fold during any betting round then the final remaining player takes the pot. If there are still two or more players after the final round of betting, there is a card showdown. In this final reveal, each active player will display their cards and at this point one or more winners will be automatically be declared the winner of the round. If the final hands are identical in ranking, the pot is evenly split between the winning players.</p>
