<li>J-5 is nicknamed ‘Jackson Five’.</li><br>

<li>‘Kojak’ stands for the K-J hand.</li><br>

<li>The 6-6 hand is also known as ‘Route 66’.</li><br>

<li>‘Hooks’ stands for the J-J hand.</li><br>

<li>‘Tight’ players play only the best hands, which improves their chances of winning the pot (small ones, most of the time).</li><br>

<li>‘Loose’ players play a lot of hands, both strong and weak ones. They think that any cards can win and will often pay to see the flop.</li><br>

<li>Strengths of passive play: allows players to play many hands, minimizes losses.</li><br>

<li>Weaknesses of passive play: losses accumulate by letting opponents see the cards drawn.</li><br>

<li>Strengths of tight play: only bets with a very good hand, minimizes the risks of loss.</li><br>

<li>Weaknesses of tight play: predictable, few played hands.</li><br>

<li>‘The nuts’ is the best possible hand in the context of the board. With the nuts, the player is sure to win.</li><br>

<li>You can change the difficulty if you think your opponent is too easy.</li><br>

<li>In easy mode, opponents tend to play more passively, almost never bluff and make more beginners’ mistakes.</li><br>

<li>In hard mode, opponents are much more aggressive and have mastered the art of bluffing. Don’t count on them making a mistake.</li><br>

<li>Opponents have their unique playing styles. Some are more aggressive, while others are born bluffers.</li><br>

<li>Practice makes champions! Don’t kid yourself - experience plays a big role in poker. As you play more hands, your reading ability and your poker intuition are sharpened.</li><br>

<li>Do your math! Odds, outs and winning chances are very important to know in poker. Get the numbers right and you should be ahead.</li><br>

<li>In tournaments, put pressure on your opponents! Sitting tight in your chair is not going to bring home lots of trophies. You have to constantly accumulate chips instead of waiting around for monster hands.</li><br>

<li>Always vary your game! One of the most important sayings in poker is: Keep your opponents guessing. If you constantly make an effort to randomize your game, they will not know whether you have a hand or not!</li><br>

<li>Don’t bluff away all your money! The big bluff should only be used rarely. It is cool to bluff but can be very unprofitable if you do it too much.</li><br>

<li>In cash games, don’t play too high for your bankroll! It may seem appealing to gamble at higher limits but as luck is a factor to be reckoned with in poker, big swings are unavoidable.</li><br>

<li>If you think you have the best hand, raise! Sometimes you are wrong and have to reconsider but being a calling station is usually the second best option.</li><br>

<li>In tournaments, don’t get eaten by the blinds and antes! Once the antes are added in a tournament, you have to kick up your game considerably.</li><br>

<li>Stay fit! Tournaments as well as cash games require a high level of concentration for long stretches of time. If you feel good about your physical condition, you will make better decisions - even at late hours.</li><br>

<li>Control your tilt! When you have lost a big hand, it is advisable just to fold the next one to get your mindset back on track. Frustration clouds your decision-making.</li>
