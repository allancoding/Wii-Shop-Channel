            <div class="style_main">Canasta - The goal of Canasta is to
win rounds and earn points by building melds (groups of three or more
same-ranked cards). Each round ends when one player has at least one
Canasta (a meld of 7 cards) and is able to get rid of every card in
their hand. The first player to 5,000 points total is the winner.<br />
            <br />
The game is played with 2 decks of cards and 4 Jokers. Jokers and 2s
are wild and are worth a lot of points.<br />
            <br />
During each turn, players must draw cards. Normally, players draw two
cards from the stock (the deck). However, if the top card on the
discard pile can be used in an existing meld that is not a Canasta, or
create a meld with at least 2 cards from the player's hand, the player
may use the top discard card instead. All the remaining cards from the
discard pile are then added to the player's hand.<br />
            <br />
To meld cards, select 3 cards or more of the same value in the player's
hand and then select your meld area. Melds can include wild cards, but
there must not be more wild cards than natural cards. Once a player is
finished melding cards, one card from their hand must be chosen for
discard. Select one card then select the discard pile to end the turn.<br />
            <br />
The initial (first) meld(s) in each round must meet the required meld
score which is shown at the top of the screen. If the player's initial
meld won't give the player enough points, they will not be allowed to
meld their cards. A player may undo the cards they have laid in their
initial meld by pressing the 1 button. If a player is unable to reach
the initial meld score, they must continue to draw cards from the deck
each turn. Once the initial score is met, players can lay any melds
they like. As a player gets closer to the end game score of 5,000
points, the initial meld score increases.<br />
            <br />
If the top card on the discard pile is used in the creation of the
initial meld, any extra cards in the discard pile may not be used to
meet the required meld score.<br />
            <br />
Freezing the discard pile - The discard pile will become "frozen" when
a wild card is discarded by one of the players (or if the first card
dealt to the discard pile is a wild card).&nbsp; When the deck is
frozen, the top discard can only be melded with at least 2 cards of the
same value, except for wild cards. This is the only way to unfreeze the
deck and collect the rest of the discard pile.<br />
            <br />
A meld of seven cards (including wild cards) or more is called a
Canasta. Canastas are worth a lot of points at the end of the round. A
player can not go out unless they have created at least one Canasta.
The round ends when one player goes out, or if there are no cards left
in the stock. Players are awarded points for their melded cards, and
penalized for any cards left in their hand when their opponent goes out.<br />
