  <p align="left"><strong><u>The Champions</u></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><u>Name:</u></strong><u> Jen Comu</u><img src="jen3.jpg" alt="j" width="180" height="250" align="right" /><br />
      <strong>Age: </strong>25<strong></strong><br />
      <strong>Kingdom: </strong>Serengania<strong></strong><br />
      <strong>Magical Preference: </strong>Ice<strong></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Background:</strong><br />
    Gifted with Ice  magic, Jen Comu was raised in Serengania as a Priestess of the Dragons.  Tattooed with ritual dragon emblems, Jen was raised to a life of discipline and dragon  worship. Jen was taught that only an Emperor of Serengania should rule the dragons  and that people should worship both the dragons and the Emperor. Upon the  return of the dragons, the young prince Weisus Xiar, 1st Son of the Dragon  Emperor, presented Jen with the book of Scale. He commanded her to take  control of the Dragon Lord of Water and obtain the remaining Tomes of Talon,  Bone and Fire. As champion of Serengania, Jen was instructed to deliver control  of all dragons to Weisus so that he can replace the Emperor and rule Serengania  in as the “Dragon Master”.</p>
  <p align="left">However, Jen  believes that the dragons should be free to rule Nakiha. So, upon leaving the Dragon Temple in  search of the Dragon Lord of Water, she ripped her formal robes and disguised  herself as a beggar to escape her bonds as champion of Serengania. Now, as a  wild and untamed dragon priestess following her own path, she intends to unite  the Tomes to free the dragons!</p>

  <p align="left"><strong><u>Name:</u></strong><u> Elziath</u><img src="elziath1.jpg" alt="elziath" width="239" height="200" align="right" /><br />
      <strong>Age: </strong>450<strong></strong><br />
      <strong>Kingdom: </strong>Andera<strong></strong><br />
      <strong>Magical Preference: </strong>Earth</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Background:</strong></p>
  <p align="left">300 years ago  Elziath was foremost amongst the magic users who banished the dragons to the great  ice wastes. Fearing that the dragon lords will destroy mankind or become the  deadly servants of an evil power, Andera has resurrected this ancient champion  to carry the Tome of Bone and banish the Dragon Lords and their Dragon kin back  to the elements from which they were created. </p>
  <p align="left">Although ancient,  Elziath is alive with earth magic. The scope of his skills and knowledge is  unmatched, only the ambitions of the other champions may defeat him. Possessing  the Tome of Bone and the secret of earth magic, Elziath now seeks the Tomes of  Scale, Talon and Fire. With them he can ensure that the Dragon Lords are  returned to the elements and he can rest in peace.</p>

  <p align="left"><strong><u>Name:</u></strong><u> Muru Moko </u><img src="MuruMoko1.jpg" alt="m" width="175" height="248" align="right" /><br />
      <strong>Age: </strong>29<strong></strong><br />
      <strong>Kingdom: </strong>Unknown<strong></strong><br />
      <strong>Magical Preference: </strong>Storm<strong></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Background:</strong><br />
    Abandoned as a peasant  child on the outskirts of Serengania, Muru Moko was named for the light and  dark spirits within him. Upon reaching manhood he trained as a warrior for the  Emperor. An athletic but quiet young man, Muru Moko became infamous for his  ability to control mists, lightning and storms. Many began to fear his power,  and so he was sent to join the Dragon Priests. It was whilst training at the  Dragon Temples of Serengania that he first met the beautiful Dragon Priestess  Jen Comu and although they wished to be together, the path of Muru Moko’s dreams  took him far from her.</p>
  <p align="left">Muru Moko was  consumed with the desire for power. He planned to release the Dragons and claim  the title of “Dragon Master”, ruler of the dragons and Emperor of Serengania.  Desperate to achieve this ambition he traveled to Arkhoniar and convinced the  kingdom to let him use the Tome of Talon to release the dragons. Once the  Dragon Lords were free, Muru Moko stole the Tome of Talon. Now he champions his  own cause; to unite the Dragon Tomes, gain dominion over all Dragon Kin and  proclaim himself “Dragon Master” and Emperor of Serengania. </p>

  <p align="left"><strong><u>Name:</u></strong><u> Vourak</u><img src="vaurak4.jpg" alt="v" width="215" height="224" align="right" /><br />
      <strong>Age: </strong>Unknown<strong></strong><br />
      <strong>Kingdom: </strong>Daeroviar<strong></strong><br />
      <strong>Magical Preference: </strong>Fire<strong></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Background:</strong><br />
    Once Muru Moko  released the Dragon Lords, Daeroviar immediately searched for a champion to win  them control of these mighty beasts and their magic. Hearing that Andera had  resurrected Elziath, the greatest magic user of the age, Daeroviar decided that  their champion must be prepared to do anything to win.</p>
  <p align="left">Vourak, demon  lord of an ancient order of knights, was summoned to champion Daeroviar’s cause.  Dragged from the realm of Vragalis, lord of destruction, Vourak's love of fire  and ruin drives his every action. Should Vourak succeed in uniting the Dragon  Tomes he will enslave the dragons and use them to burn, crush and destroy  everything in his path, upholding his belief that only the strong survive.</p>
