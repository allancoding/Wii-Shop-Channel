                    <p class="spacer20tu"><b>Classic Lawn Darts</b> – Eight Innings. Players throw three darts per inning at a Red Dot Bonus bull's eye, which is surrounded by an inner circle and an outer circle. </p>
                    <p class="spacer20tu">The outer circle is worth 1 point, the inner circle is 3 points, and the Red Dot Bonus increases incrementally by five from 5 points in the first inning to 40 points in the eighth inning.  The player with the highest score wins. Pro Points are used to determine a winner in case of a tie.</p>
                    <p class="spacer20tu"><strong>Note:</strong> There is a settings option to randomize the target location. Select <strong>Random Target</strong> under Classic Settings to randomly move the target between innings.</p>
                    <img src="ph_11_02.png" width="207" height="163" style="margin:0 0 0 10px;float:right;" />
                    <p class="spacer20tu"><b>501</b> – Eight Rounds Maximum. There is a <strong>Score</strong> option to play 301, 501, 701 or 901. Each player starts with 301,  501, 701 or 901 points. Players throw three darts per round in an attempt to  hit as many high value numbers as possible. </p>
                    <p class="spacer20tu">The numbers circling the dartboard  represent a corresponding area on the board, and are worth that amount of  points, except for the double area on the outer edge of the board, which  doubles that amount of points, and the triple area on the interior, which  triples the points. For example, a triple 20 is worth 60 points. Green bull's  eyes are worth 25 points and red bull's eyes are worth 50 points. By turning on <strong>Fat Board</strong> at the start of the game,  the size of the doubles and triples are increased making them easier to hit.</p>
                    <p class="spacer20tu">After each throw, the outcome is subtracted from the 501-point total (or 301, 701 or 901). The goal is to remove all points from the scoreboard to reach zero without going over. If the game ends because the maximum number of rounds have been reached before any player reaches zero, the winner is the player with the lowest total score. There is an option at the start of the game to turn on  or off <strong>Double Out</strong>. When it is on  players must get the final point total by hitting a double with the last shot.  With Double Out off, a player can finish by hitting any number that zeroes out  the points.</p>
                    <img src="ph_11_03.png" width="207" height="163" style="margin:0 0 0 10px;float:right;" />
                    <p class="spacer20tu"><b>Cricket</b> – 16 Rounds Maximum. By turning on <strong>Fat  Board</strong> at the start of the game, the size of the doubles and triples are  increased making them easier to hit. The numbers circling the dartboard represent a corresponding area on the board. Players throw three darts per round at the following numbers on the dartboard: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and the bull's eye. </p>
                    <p class="spacer20tu">Players attempt to &quot;close&quot; one of the designated numbers by hitting it three times. Once Player One has closed a number, and Player Two has not, Player One can score points by hitting that number until Player Two closes it. Game play ends either at the end of sixteen rounds, or when a player has closed out all of the designated numbers. The winner is the player with the highest point total.</p>
                    <p class="spacer20tu">Only hitting the designated numbers count toward the point total as &quot;good&quot; throws. Hitting any other number is considered a miss. Hitting a double area on the outer edge of the board is worth two, and hitting the triple area inside the board is worth three. For example, hitting a double 17 counts as two, and you only need to hit 17 one more time to finish that number. The center red bull's eye is a double score.</p>
                    <img src="ph_11_04.png" width="207" height="163" style="margin:0 0 0 10px;float:right;" />
                    <p class="spacer20tu"><b>Poker Darts</b> – Three Hands. Players throw five darts per hand at a deck of 52 playing cards while attempting to get the best poker hand. The highest scoring hand is a Royal Flush, which scores 1500 points during the first hand, then points are doubled in the second hand and tripled in the third hand. Other good hands include: Straight Flush, 4 of a kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, 3 of a Kind, 2 Pair and a single Pair. Numbered cards score the same point value as appears on the face of the card. For example, a 9 of diamonds is worth 9 points. Likewise, a Jack/15, Queen/20, King/25 and Ace/30.</p>
                    <p class="spacer20tu">When a player receives points for a good hand, such as 100 points for a Pair, the points are added to the score the player has received for the individual cards. For example if a player hits one 6 of hearts and one 6 of diamonds, that player is awarded a total of 112 points.</p>
                    <p class="spacer20tu">If Player One beats Player Two at the end of any hand there is a 100-point bonus. If Player One beats Player Two and Player Three, that player receives a 200-point bonus (100 points for each player defeated).</p>
