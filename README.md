# Wii Shop Channel Restoration Project
This project is a restoration of the Wii Shop Channel. The Wii Shop Channel was a digital distribution channel for the Wii video game console that allowed users to download games and other software by purchasing Nintendo Points which could be bought with a credit card or a Wii Points Card from a retail outlet. The channel was launched on December 10, 2006, and ceased operations on January 30, 2019. The project is a work in progress and is not affiliated with Nintendo in any way.

## About
- I modified the Wii Shop Channel to use the RiiConnect24 servers to allow the Wii Shop Channel to be used again. The domain use is now `shop.rc24.xyz` instead of `oss-auth.shop.wii.com`. Right now that domain does not exist yet so just use a service like PI-Hole to redirect the domain to a local server.
- Should be safe to install on a Wii console. I have tested it on dolphin and it works fine. I have not tested it on a real Wii console yet.

## Installation
1. Download the `Wii Shop Channel.wad` from the repository. Or from the [releases](https://github.com/allancoding/Wii-Shop-Channel/releases/tag/wad-build) page.
2. Install the WAD file using a WAD manager on your Wii console.
